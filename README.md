#CM3005 - Data Science

The project aims to find relationships between the time, interest rate and the price of stock indices whether a linear regression model can find out more about their relationships and use visualizations to project the relationships between time, interest rate and stock indices. 

##1)Introduction
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that will aid to help us predict the share price of a stock exchange such as NASDAQ if the US's federal reserve interest rate were to increase or decrease with the use of linear regression algorithm.

##2)Domain-Specific Task and Objectives Of the Project
The Domain-Specific Task is to identify the relationship between the US's federal reserve interest rate and multiple stock exchanges with linear regression.

The impact of the federal reserve interest rate is tremendous on the stock market and signals a great increment or decrement on stock prices. In 2022, when the federal reserve decides to raise the interest rate of the to 3.9%, we could see major stock exchanges had a decline in the prices of the stocks. In 2022, when the federal reserve had announced the increase in interest rate, the S&P 500 as compared to the previous year had fallen which could be seen from the closing price of S&P 500 according to yahoo finance was at Aug 1st 2022 at 4118.63 and Aug 2 2021 at 4422.81 which was a 7% decrease from the previous year. The same scenario is found in the early 2000s, where the federal reserve interest rate rose in the year 2000 and the S&P had fallen by 10.14% but the interest rate began to increase from 4.63% in january 1999 to 6.40% in december 2000.

The contributions which a linear regression machine learning model could help would be to predict the future stock prices if the federal reserve were to decide to raise or lower the interest rates. The machine learning model could help policymakers make better decisions to mitigate the impact of stock market fluctuations on the stock market.

Therefore, the importance of the interest rates to stock prices is justified by historical events and we would want to see if we are able to predict the stock prices increment or decrement based on the interest rates with time series data of the stock prices and the interest rates of the federal reserve with the following objectives:
